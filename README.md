# Lando Hostfile
Beware! This lando plugin is not fully tested on all systems.
If you intend to use this, please backup your host file first.

## Windows Users
Until sudo is widely available for Windows, install gsudo https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo for privilege escalation.

## WSL2
WSL2 is supported. It doesn't matter wether lando is installed in WSL or on Windows.
If you're running lando from within WSL, the plugin will attempt to update both hostfiles.
